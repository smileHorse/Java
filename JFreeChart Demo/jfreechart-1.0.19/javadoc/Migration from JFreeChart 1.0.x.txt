Migration from JFreeChart 1.0.x

When migrating from JFreeChart 1.0.x to JFreeChart 1.5.0, please be aware of the following API changes:

    all the classes from JCommon that are used by JFreeChart have integrated within the JFreeChart jar file within a different package than before (you will need to change your imports);
    many methods getBaseXXX()/setBaseXXX() have been renamed setDefaultXXX()/getDefaultXXX();
    the ChartUtilities class has been renamed ChartUtils;
    all the classes relating to pseudo-3D charts have been removed, as much better 3D charts are offered by Orson Charts so we prefer not to maintain the pseudo-3D chart code within JFreeChart;
    the SegmentedTimeline class has been removed due to being (a) complex, (b) not always being correct and, as a result, generating too many support requests;
    the org.jfree.chart.utils.ParamChecks class has been renamed org.jfree.chart.utils.Args.
